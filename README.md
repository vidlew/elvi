Veronica2: Search gopher. Gopher is a text-only internet protocol and home to lots of cool people and gopher-exclusive content.

Gus: Search geminispace. Gemini is a new text-based internet protocol that's more secure than gopher. It's home to a few cool people and some gemini-exclusive content.

Ahmia: Search the dark web. The dark web is actually really boring unless you're trying to buy drugs.
